# Using-Nerfstudio-at-on-hand-devices

Thanks to UC Berkely students, I could apply NeRF model easier than ever. 

nerfstudio provides the Data Preprocess, Data Loader, Model Training, Visualizing, and Rendering required to implement the NeRF model in API form. We also provide NeRF source codes made with API.

There is also a paper introducing the Framework.

A Modular Framework for Neural Radiance Field Development, Matthew Tancik, arXiv 2023

In this article, we summarize the contents of the official website.

We will introduce the NeRF model / component module / data preprocessing / viewer supported by nerfstudio, and also introduce the execution results after setting up the development environment.



This contents is about applying NeRF models by data created on iPhone 14 Pro.  


Using 
* Conda
* COLMAP
* Docker
* Ubuntu 18.04
* SSH server (NVIDIA TITAN XP)
